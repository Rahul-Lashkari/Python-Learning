"""
This repository contains Python programs and code snippets that showcase various concepts,
ranging from basics to advanced topics. It also includes practice sets and examples
to reinforce key ideas and improve mastery.

I studied Python, Pandas, MySQL, and many related concepts during my high school since
even before age 13, so I already have a solid foundation.

This repository serves as a quick recap & continuation of my learning journey,
with a focus on mastering Python and exploring its vast potential further.
